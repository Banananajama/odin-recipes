    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple stew has a gravy-like sauce that benefits from browning the beef first, but you can also just throw everything in the slow cooker pot and it will still taste great.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp vegetable, sunflower or rapeseed oil</li>
        <li>400–500g/14oz–1lb 2oz beef skirt, braising steaks or diced beef, chopped into 4–5cm/1½ –2in chunks</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
        <li>4 tbsp gravy granules</li>
        <li>2 tbsp wholegrain mustard</li>
        <li>1 beef stock cube, crumbled</li>
        <li>350g/12oz carrots, peeled and cut into 2–3cm/¾–1¼in batons</li>
        <li>600g/1lb 5oz potatoes, peeled and cut into 4–5cm/1½ –2in chunks</li>
        <li>400g/14oz frozen peas</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a heavy-based frying pan. Divide the beef into two batches and add the first batch to the pan. Turn the beef to sear and colour on all sides to a rich, dark brown. Transfer the browned chunks straight to the slow cooker pot. Repeat with the remaining oil and beef.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, gravy granules, mustard and stock cube to the pot and pour in 550ml/1 pint water. Give everything a quick stir, then add the carrots and potatoes. Cover with the lid and cook for 7 hours on low. Stir once during cooking, if you are at home, to rotate the meaty chunks sitting on the top. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, Steam, microwave or boil the peas for 3–4 minutes until cooked. </li>
        <li>Season the stew with salt and pepper. Ladle portions of the stew onto plates. Serve the green peas alongside.</li>
    </ol>
